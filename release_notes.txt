release notes v. 1.1
********************

- replaced egrep with grep -E commands internally to avoid unnecessary warnings
- changed format of .tmp database file saved after 30 manual ratings to be of the regular db format.
  It can be used just like a normal db now if necessary.
- implemented a timeout after an hour for module selection on the first screen
- implemented timeouts in the categorisation module so that if there is no activity for three hours, 
  categorisations up to that point will be saved and the programme will exit. This prevents potential
  errors when temporary files are deleted by the OS while the programme is left open and waiting for 
  categorisation input for days.
- added hours, minutes and seconds (in addition to date) to the dated filenames for databases to make it
  easier to keep track of most recent versions of these files
- when producing output files from partially categorised data, a note is added to ech incomplete row of
  the output file to say it is incomplete, but categorisations were saved in the database nonetheless.
- updated manual and README file



release notes v. 1.0.2
**********************

- Renamed software licence file to LICENSE.txt
- added a folder with a large categorisation database (Cardiff_database) for use with the WADP.
- included a copy of the main script named WADP_macOS.command to faciliate easier handling under macOS.

release notes v. 1.0
********************

This version brings revisions to simplify installation by combining all subscripts into the main script file (WADP.sh) and updating installers to work with the latest security features of macOS/Linux/Windows. The Windows version switches support from Cygwin to Windows Subsystem for Linux. Further, the following enhancements were made
- csv processing was enhanced to better represent double and single quotation marks in output files
- the application window/terminal window resizes automatically to the correct size
- streamlined some of the verbosity in the reporter module
- manual and README files updated, added links to instruction videos on installation and use of the WADP

release notes v. 0.7.2
**********************

Fixed a potential problem under MacOS X that would throw a security error when WADP.app seeks to open the Terminal application. Instead of installing the WADP.app, a WADP.command file (identical to WADP.sh) is installed in the applications folder and, if desired, on the desktop. installer.sh was adjusted to remove any existing WADP.app files.
