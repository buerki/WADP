README

The database 'CARDIFF_PROJECT_database02092019.dat' contains categorisations for a large number of cue-response pairs. Categorisations are based on the categorisation scheme described in Fitzpatrick et al (2015) and were derived by researchers at the Centre for Language and Communication Research at Cardiff University, Wales during the course of consecutive research projects (cf. Buerki forthcoming). Like the other parts of the software, the database is licensed under the EUPL v.1.2. Please note particularly paragraph 7 of the licence. 

The database can be used to facilitate categorisations of word association cue-response pairs at increased speed in cases where the same categorisation scheme is applied and at least some of the same cue words are used (the cue words contained in the database are listed below). In such cases, categorisations of cue-response pairs contained in the database will automatically be pulled from the database to assign categories and only rare responses to cues will need to be categorised manually. As noted in Buerki (forthcoming), the correct categorisation of a given cue-response pair may depend on individual and contextual factors and the categorisations contained in the database may not therefore be appropriate in all contexts. Further, although all categorisations in the database were agreed separately rated by at least two researchers and any differences between them were resolved by a team of researchers, there may be categorisation decisions in the database that others might disagree with. Researchers should therefore consider carefully whether the use of this database is appropriate for their context, purpose and research questions.
